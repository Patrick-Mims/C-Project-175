# C-Project-175
Write a program that sorts a series of words entered by the user:

Enter word: foo
Enter word: bar
Enter word: baz
Enter word: quux
Enter word: 

In sorted order: bar baz foo quux

Task
Assume that each word is more than 20 characters long. Stop reading when the user enters an empty word (i.e, presses Enter without entering a word). Store each word in a dynamically allocated string, using an array of pointers to keep track of the strings. After all the words have been read, sort the array (using any sorting technique) and then use a loop to print the words in sorted order.
